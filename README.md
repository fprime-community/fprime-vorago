# fprime-vorago

This repository contains common components and support software for the Vorago [VA41620][1]/[VA41630][2] microcontrollers running with no RTOS (i.e. on the bare metal). We anticipate the possibility of expanding this repository to support RTOSes and other Vorago microcontrollers.

This repository is maintained by a development group within JPL. Contact [Cel Skeggs][3] for more information.
